## Question 1: 
Even though the "message" feature is critical in a messaging application, its dependence on multiple interacting components like UI, network, and database make it not ideal for unit testing. Instead, the integration or end-to-end tests are more suitable to ensure the entire messaging process functions smoothly as intended.

## Question 2: 
Unit testing is ideal for the "max message length" feature, which restricts user input to no more than 80 characters, operates with a clear, isolated logic that can be tested independently. A unit test can simulate inputs to the system and check whether the length constraint is enforced accurately, providing a straightforward verification of this specific functionality.
